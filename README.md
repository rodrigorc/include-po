# include-po

Crate to include gettext message catalogs (PO files) directly into
your Rust programs, as compilable Rust modules.

To be used together with the [`tr`](https://crates.io/crates/tr) crate.

If you want to use a different translation engine, just open an issue
or a pull request and I'll do my best.
